# Physical Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei Predictions
## Abstract

In this study, we introduce a novel neural network model designed to estimate the bolometric luminosity and mass of Active Galactic Nuclei using spectral data from the Rakshit catalogue. 
Focusing on the H-Beta singlet peak and the [O III] doublet peaks, our model leverages observable spectral features to predict AGN characteristics, bypassing the need for extensive spectral energy distribution extrapolations and resource-intensive reverberation mapping methods. 
Our approach enhances efficiency and speed, making it ideal for analysing large datasets. Evaluation of our model demonstrates its ability to predict AGN properties with a dex of 0.34 for logMBH and 0.31 for LogREdd, indicating a promising tool for advancing the understanding of AGN and their impact on galaxy evolution.
